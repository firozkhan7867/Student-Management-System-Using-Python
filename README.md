# Student-Management-System-Using-Python

### one of the most and first ever project which helped me to gain confidence  in python programming
its been 2 years since i started my python journey , this was my 2 years old project which gave me confidence and excitment to explore more in python,

## Tkinter Programming using Python

Since Python comes with Pre installed Tkinter library with which we can make excellent cross platfrom desktop application, its responsive nd easy to implement feature make me enthusiastic.
It was fun coding this project along the guidance of youtube tutorial, I alse Added additional feature like login , Create User

# Home Page 

the home page will Gives to choices Either Login as Admin or login as a regular user to view data, 
The Admin Login Has all the control over the application , Can Delete users, can modify their details , 

### this is what it looks like

Admin has separate login , Normal regular user has separate login page, which make different tabs from each other

#

# Admin DashBoard 

### where he can monitor all the user who has logged in previously.this extracts data directly from Psql Data Base. 

All the details of the user data is stored in separate Psql DataBase.

# Login Page

### The login page is simple with two form widget, 
This allows the user to give input values like UserName , Password, 

By clicking the login button, Python  is going to retrieve data from the data Base nd validate the user information, 
If the user was valid we will get the Successfull login notification , And user can Login,

### If the User Is new to the Application, 
he can Create his new account by clicking on Create User Button, which will leads to the Secret key tab
The secret key is only available to the Admin so only Admin User can Create User ,
